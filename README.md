# plant_growth
A new model for evolving virtual plant species. The plant is modelled as a polygon with a neural net that is evaluated across each node. Each node detects its light, water and curvature and may grow along its normal vector. If a plant attempts to consume more energy than it collects it will die.

The first batch of grown plants is collected here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6nTquhrGRMTVMFlYDQ4BDa7zjwPdlekO
