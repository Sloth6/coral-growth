# coral_growth
A new model for evolving virtual coral species. The coral is modelled as a polygon with a neural net that is evaluated across each node. Each node detects its light, water and curvature and may grow along its normal vector. If a coral attempts to consume more energy than it collects it will die.

The first batch of grown corals is collected here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6nTquhrGRMTVMFlYDQ4BDa7zjwPdlekO
